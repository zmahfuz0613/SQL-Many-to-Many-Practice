# Many to many relationships: Using join tables!

## Introduction

In this lab you will be writing queries to gain insight into our movies database. The `movies_db` consists of four tables. You are already familiar with the `movies` and the `directors` tables. The two new tables are the `users` and the `users_movies` tables.

- The `users` table simply holds user records. These records only store a `name` string of a user. 
- The `users_movies` table represents a many to many relationship between the users table and the movies table. These types of tables are sometimes referred to as "join tables". 

The naming of the table ("`users_movies`") might sound strange, but it is a common naming convention you will certainly come across. This is just a concatenation of the two table names that it is joining. 

Sometimes, the join table represents an idea that lends itself to a better name. In our case, we could have named the table `favorites` or something like that. But it's good to see and get used to this naming convention also.

### Setup

In this directory you will find a `movies_db` directory. Run this command to set up your database:

```
psql -f seed.sql
```

After that, you should be all set to write the queries requested below.

For this lab, you are expected to use the psql command line interface. For your convenience though, I have added a `queries.sql` file to movies_db directory. Feel free to write your queries in there and run them in psql with the `\i` command. It should look something like this:

```
$ psql movies_lab_db
psql (9.6.1)
Type "help" for help.

movies_lab_db=# \i queries.sql
 id |  name
 ----+---------
 1 | John
 2 | Ari
 3 | Ramsey
 4 | Drew
 5 | J
 6 | Dominic
(6 rows)

movies_lab_db=#
```

As you can see, my `queries.sql` file probably had something like `SELECT * FROM users;` in it.

### Queries

1. List all the movie titles and their corresponding directors.
2. Select the movie title and user name for all of the "favorites" represented by the `users_movies` table.
3. List the movies with the number of favorites they have.
4. List the names of directors along with the number of favorites that exist for all of the movies they've made, ordered by number of favorites descending.
5. List the user name, director name and favorite count of all of the user/director combinations (based on the `users_movies` table).

### Deliverables

- A completed `queries.sql` that has SQL queries that accomplish the above four requests.
